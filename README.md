Questbook 

# About us:
Questbook is a upcoming application that will allow you to save your roleplay stories within an application. The specifics of the program are still in the planning phases but it will be written in the C++ language with a plan to have it availble in the Microsoft Window store.

# Main Branch:
Our main branch is going to be our production branch and it will be dormant until the project maintainer releases an alpha version of our project.

# Development Branch:
Please check out our development branch for live updates. The main branch shall not be update until Version 1.0 - Alpha is released. Please note that the development branch will contain unstable code and rapid changes or even unfinished code throughout the design phase of our project.

# Documentation:
Since our documentation is changing as we plan out the program we have put our documentation into a google document for further review and to prevent 100s of commits. As with our code, the documentation may change numerous times and nothing in the document is considered to be set in stone.

# Contributions
No open source contributions will be accepted until the release of our alpha version of our project.
